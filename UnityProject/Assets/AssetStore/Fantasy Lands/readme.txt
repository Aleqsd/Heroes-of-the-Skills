Thank you for purchasing my pack!

Fantasy Lands is a hand-painted low poly environment pack you can use for designing both desktop and mobile games. 
While it can be used for 1st person games, as well, the pack was created to offer the best quality when used for 3rd person or top-down view applications.
This is just a demo pack that uses a very small part of the assets you will find in the complete pack.

The demo contains 18 free assets:
2 houses combined in one (you can use them individually as needed)
4 plants and shrooms
3 small and big trees
7 handpainted terrain textures
2 particle prefabs
1 demo scene

What you can find inside the complete package?
Over 180 assets!
- 37 houses and log cabins along with several roof color variations
the roof color variations can be used for night scenes
all the houses can be combined to form new houses and saved as prefabs
each house comes with its own window covers that can be rotated, closed and opened as needed
you can further embellish the houses by adding banners and shop signs and save them later as new prefabs
- over 34 marketplace props, including crates, tables, market stalls, barrels and baskets filled with produce and more
- 34 banners and banner strings variations
- 14 fountains and wells with 5 different water color materials and a custom water shader
- 18 log fences
- 12 road props including post signs, wooden and stone bridges and tree lawns
- 39 trees, plants, logs and shrooms
- 9 handpainted tilable terrain textures
- 7 particle prefabs
- 5 demo scenes including one for mobile


All the assets are highly optimised, low poly, and they are sharing the same texture atlass. They are perfect for both desktop and mobile use!
You can combine the assets and save them as new prefabs with little performance cost!
